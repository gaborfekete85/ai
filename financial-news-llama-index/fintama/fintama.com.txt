Goals-based adviceGoals-based advice is an alternative to the traditional risk-profiling approach based on modern portfolio theory. Instead of starting with risk tolerance, goals-based advice focuses specifically on meeting clients' financial objectives, by maximizing the likelihood of achieving a future cashflow. This allows for more freedom in portfolio construction whilst decreasing short-term attention on performance and helps to foster long-term client relationships.
