Solana's Saga Phone And Now It Is Selling As An NFTby Mehab Qureshi, Benzinga Staff Writer¬† January 19, 2024 6:08 AM |  2 min read Loading...Loading...A Solana SOL/USD influencer known as Bangerz microwaved one of the limited edition Solana Saga smartphones and shared the video on X.¬†What Happened: Bangerz, who identifies as a ‚Äúwashed-up influencer‚Äù and is also the co-founder and CEO of NFT launchpad 3.land, uploaded footage of the device sizzling in the microwave.¬†
I microwaved my @solanamobile SagaHere are the results: pic.twitter.com/OGuWpk7FDZ‚Äî bangerz üëΩ {3.LAND} (@bangerzNFT) January 18, 2024
It should be noted that Solana Saga phones, which previously had trouble finding buyers, have sold out, fetching prices as high as $7,000 on eBay. Since the Saga phone's launch on May 8, each new phone has been accompanied by a free airdrop of 30 million Bonk BONK/USD tokens.¬†Upon removal, the phone was seen emanating steam and leaking an unidentified substance while its screen peeled away from the frame. She noted the obvious in her video, declaring, "It's damaged. It's not turning on."Following the viral incident on X, Bangerz capitalized on the moment by launching 3,333 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of the microwaved phone. The NFTs were offered at no cost for minting through 3.land.¬†

‚ÄúSaga phones are now deflationary. Commemorate this moment with the Saga Microwave," posted 3.land.

These ‚ÄúSaga Microwave‚Äù NFTs rapidly found their way to secondary marketplaces, trading for about $25 worth of Solana at peak value, though the enthusiasm waned and prices dropped. The collection has managed to garner approximately $33,000 in trades.Loading...Loading...See More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data RevealsWhy It Matters: This comes as Solana Labs unveiled its plans for a sequel dubbed ‚ÄúChapter 2,‚Äù a more budget-friendly model priced at $450, compared to the original Saga‚Äôs higher price tag.
