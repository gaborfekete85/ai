Youâre not alone. In fact, both bankers and clients recognise that despite prominent claims of client-centricity and personal banking, the financial industry is far behind in client servicing, leaving much to be desired. Thatâs where we come in.We started Fintama to help financial institutions better serve their clients, society, as well as themselves. We believe that this is best done by creating compelling products and services that people love to use. And it was our foundation in science, data, and quantitative finance coupled with our enthusiasm to build such productsÂ withÂ our clients which brought our founders Heiko, Amardeep, Gurmit, and Christian together.With motivation in hand, now they needed a name. During a multi-day branding workshop, the team mulled over the vision ultimately giving life to Fintama, and with it the slogan.âFintama[finÂ âÂ taÂ â ma]âââWhile having a catchy ring, there is much more behind it. Fintama is derived from a combination of the wordÂ finance, and the Punjabi wordÂ Ã¥tmÄÂ (à¨à¨¤à¨®à¨¾), meaning soul. The words conjure up images of two very different environments: the one exact and rigid, and the other spiritual and wise. Marrying these in an age-old industry requires fusing business and technology with human-centric design to create products and services bringing a new spirit into the financial industry. The slogan âBreathing life into financeâ was born.Designing relevant and sustainable products remains a permanent fixture on corporate agendas as it has been for some time.Â Read moreÂ about our service and solution offerings and how we can support you on your journey to create the products of tomorrow for your clients, today.âWant to join us, or partner up on our journey?

Datatransfer and Transfer of Data AbroadIn the context of our business activities and in line with the purposes of the data processing set out in Section 3, we may transfer data to third parties, insofar as such a transfer is permitted and we deem it appropriate, in order for them to process data for us or, as the case may be, their own purposes. In particular, the following categories of recipients may be concerned: our group entities and affiliates;our service providers (e.g. asset managers, banks, insurances), including processors (such as e.g. IT providers);domestic and foreign authorities, government agencies, courts and anti-money laundering self-regulatory organizations;competitors, industry organizations, associations, organizations and other bodies;acquirers or parties interested in the acquisition of business divisions, companies or other parts of Fintama;other parties in possible or pending legal proceedings;Certain Recipients may be within Switzerland but they may be located in any country worldwide. In particular, you must anticipate your data to be transmitted to other countries in Europe and the USA where our service providers or their headquarters are located (such as Microsoft).Â If a recipient is located in a country without adequate statutory data protection, we require the recipient to undertake to comply with data protection (for this purpose, we use the revised European Commissionâs standard contractual clauses, which can be accessed here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj), unless the recipient is subject to a legally accepted set of rules to ensure data protection and unless we cannot rely on an exception. An exception may apply for example in case of legal proceedings abroad, but also in cases of overriding public interest or if the performance of a contract requires disclosure, if you have consented or if data has been made available generally by you and you have not objected against the processing.6. Retention Periods for your Personal DataâWe process and retain your personal data as long as required for the performance of our contractual obligation and compliance with legal obligations or other purposes pursued with the processing, i.e. for the duration of the entire business relationship (from the initiation, during the performance of the contract until it is terminated) as well as beyond this duration in accordance with legal retention and documentation obligations. Personal data may be retained for the period during which claims can be asserted against our company or insofar as we are otherwise legally obliged to do so or if legitimate business interests require further retention (e.g., for evidence and documentation purposes). As soon as your personal data are no longer required for the above-mentioned purposes, they will be deleted or anonymized, to the extent possible. In general, shorter retention periods of no more than twelve months apply for operational data (e.g., system logs).7. Data SecurityWe have taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access and misuse such as internal policies, training, IT and network security solutions, access controls and restrictions, encryption of data carriers and transmissions, pseudonymization, inspections.8. Obligation to Provide Personal Data To UsIn the context of our business relationship you must provide us with any personal data that is necessary for the conclusion and performance of a business relationship and the performance of our contractual obligations (as a rule, there is no statutory requirement to provide us with data). Without this information, we will usually not be able to enter into or carry out a contract with you (or the entity or person you represent). In addition, the website cannot be used unless certain information is disclosed to enable data traffic (e.g. IP address).9. Your RightsIn accordance with and as far as provided by applicable law (as is the case where the GDPR is applicable), you have the right to access, rectification and erasure of your personal data, the right to restriction of processing or to object to our data processing, in particular for direct marketing purposes and for other legitimate interests in processing in addition to right to receive certain personal data for transfer to another controller (data portability). Please note, however, that we reserve the right to enforce statutory restrictions on our part, for example if we are obliged to retain or process certain data, have an overriding interest (insofar as we may invoke such interests) or need the data for asserting claims. If exercising certain rights will incur costs on you, we will notify you thereof in advance. We have already informed you of the possibility to withdraw consent in Section 3 above. Please further note that the exercise of these rights may be in conflict with your contractual obligations and this may result in consequences such as premature contract termination or involve costs. If this is the case, we will inform you in advance unless it has already been contractually agreed upon.Â In general, exercising these rights requires that you are able to prove your identity (e.g., by a copy of identification documents where your identity is not evident otherwise or can be verified in another way). In order to assert these rights, please contact us at the addresses provided in Section 1 above.Â In addition, every data subject has the right to enforce his/her rights in court or to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority.

16, blog portfolio optimization for low risk investors," blog portfolio optimization for low risk investors. Portfolio optimization for low risk investors  ProductsSolutionsServicesCase StudiesBlogCareersContactContact usFintama AGBellerivestrasse 29, 8008 Zurich, Switzerland+41 43 499 19 60contact@fintama.comPortfolio optimization for low risk investorsWith the rise in popularity of smart beta strategies, minimum-variance investing has moved into the spotlight of the financial industry.The challengeThe path towards portfolio optimization is one strewn with challenges - and with what seems like a rolling conveyor of proposed solutions tumbling off the belt in academia, the challenge for us as practitioners becomes actually selecting one. But our quest towards selecting that single âbestâ strategy may be whatâs clouding our vision. Even what appears to be a well-developed strategy ex-ante, may perform poorly in reality. After all, financial markets behave erratically and dynamically as we have all observed through moody downturns and seemingly hope-fueled gains during the pandemic. The solution? Consider ditching the single strategy approach.Â âOur solutionThink of it as bringing the benefits of diversification from the portfolio to the estimation level, thereby overcoming the strategy selection problem. Our âsmartâ- optimization approach averages the plethora of minimum-variance strategies and leverages the time-series properties of returns. Through extensive testing, this proposed averaging rule achieves a lower out-of-sample portfolio standard deviation and higher risk-adjusted performance than any competing minimum-variance strategy. It not only offers sizable diversification benefits, but also lower turnover and less short interest. Given the nature of this approach, it is best suited to those seeking a low risk / low volatility strategy including conservative investors, pension funds and insurance solutions.Â âSolution detailsEven the most sophisticated portfolio optimization techniques rarely outperform an equally distributed portfolio strategy out-of-sample. This is due to the inherent estimation errors stemming from the estimation of the covariance matrix. Various estimators have been proposed to reduce the estimation error whereby the estimation errors of these estimators are lowly correlated with each other. Averaging exploits this low correlation by combining the unbiased sample estimator with a multitude of structured estimators. Essentially, if estimation errors can be reduced by combining the sample with one structured estimator, averaging over multiple estimators should offer further diversification potential. This approach combines the individual estimators such that the expected out-of-sample variance of the corresponding minimum-variance portfolio is minimized. In a simulation study, we show that this leads to favorable distributions for out-of-sample standard deviation and Sharpe ratio as shown in Figures 1 and 2 compared to existing strategies.Â Figure 1 Distribution of Out-of-Sample Standard DeviationsFigure 2 Distribution of Out-of-Sample Sharpe RatiosâThe results are robust to transaction costs and the framework is flexible to be extended with additional restrictions like short-sale constraints or alternative averaging approaches.Â âIf you would like to learn more about the solution or discuss how this approach could benefit your clients and your organization, please contact us.âDisclaimerThis report was written and produced by Fintama AG.
